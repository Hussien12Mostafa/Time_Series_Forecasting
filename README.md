# Time Series Forecasting with SARIMA and Holt-Winters
This repository contains Python code that demonstrates time series forecasting using SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and Holt-Winters methods. The code showcases how to preprocess time series data, build SARIMA and Holt-Winters models, forecast future values, and evaluate the models using RMSE and MAE metrics.
